<p>Did you ever feel uncomfortable when modeling workflows? Because you miss something, or repeat yourself (hello, Aris) in one or another tool or notation?</p>

<p>I did. For more than two decades. And I thought it was my fault: that I did not understand the concept well enough. So I painted my processes as good as I could, given the technical or mental constraints at any time.</p>

<p>Now, after thousands of processes analyzed and a few workflow engines implemented myself: finally I took some time to compare workflow notations formally, on a metamodel level.</p>

<p><img src="/meta-workflow/graph-colored-overview.png" alt="Workflow Metamodel Comparison overview" /></p>

<p>Among various formal notations I also added a simple definition of an Event: <em>“a change of state”</em>. Because some notations talk about States, others about Events.</p>

<p>For example in the case of H²O, there can be -at least- two states: solid (ice) and liquid (water). We call the Event which changes the state <em>“melting”</em>.</p>

<p>And that disctinction made something clear to me: Some notations omit State (EPK, BPMN). Others omit Events or Activities.</p>

<p>Yes you can mimic State by modeling Events for it. But it does not make the model intuitive to understand. Because <em>“melting”</em> and <em>“liquid water”</em> are two different phenomena.</p>

<p>As a conclusion I added a simple hyper-notation which can express all facets of workflow / state machines. That Knowledge-Transformation (KxFm) notation can act as an interchange notation for migrating between notations or tools. Because all models of the other analyzed notations can be expressed in the KxFm notation.</p>

<p>I hope that this overview helps you to understand your favourite notation a little better.</p>

<p>Please send me comments on this paper so that I can improve it. Thank you for reading!</p>
